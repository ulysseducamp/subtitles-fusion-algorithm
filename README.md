# Smart Subtitles

[![License: AGPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-AGPL%20v3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0)

An adaptive bilingual subtitle system that creates personalized learning experiences by intelligently switching between target language and native language subtitles based on the user's vocabulary knowledge.

## Overview

Smart Subtitles uses frequency lists to determine which words the user "knows" and makes real-time decisions about subtitle language selection. The system provides:

- **Adaptive Learning**: Automatically adjusts difficulty based on vocabulary knowledge
- **Seamless Experience**: No manual switching between subtitle languages
- **Vocabulary Building**: Inline translation for single unknown words
- **Time Synchronization**: Advanced algorithm for perfect subtitle timing alignment
- **Multi-language Support**: Works with English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, German, and Italian

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Python 3 (for lemmatization)
- TypeScript compiler

### Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd prototype

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install simplemma

# Build TypeScript
npm run build
```

### Required Files

- **Frequency Lists**: Place in `frequency-lists/` directory
- **SRT Files**: Target and native language subtitle files
- **DeepL API Key**: For inline translation feature (optional)

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Run with basic parameters
node dist/main.js --target fr.srt --native en.srt --freq frequency-lists/fr-5000.txt --out hybrid.srt --topN 2000 --lang fr --native-lang en

# Run with inline translation
node dist/main.js --target fr.srt --native en.srt --freq frequency-lists/fr-5000.txt --out hybrid.srt --topN 2000 --lang fr --native-lang en --inline-translation
```

### Command Line Options

- `--target`: Target language SRT file (language being learned)
- `--native`: Native language SRT file (user's native language)
- `--freq`: Frequency list file for vocabulary analysis
- `--out`: Output file for hybrid subtitles
- `--topN`: Number of most frequent words to consider "known"
- `--lang`: Target language code (fr, en, es, de, it, pt)
- `--native-lang`: Native language code
- `--inline-translation`: Enable inline translation for single unknown words

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **SRT Parsing and Generation**: Full support for SubRip subtitle format
- **Vocabulary-based Selection**: Intelligent language switching based on word frequency
- **Bidirectional Synchronization**: Advanced time alignment between subtitle versions
- **Inline Translation**: Single-word translation using DeepL API
- **Proper Noun Detection**: Smart identification of names and places
- **Contraction Handling**: English contraction processing
- **Overlapping Subtitle Merging**: Temporal alignment of complex subtitle sequences

### Supported Languages

- English (en)
- French (fr)
- Portuguese (pt)
- Spanish (es)
- German (de)
- Italian (it)

node tests/test-deepl.js
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Edit TypeScript**: Modify files in `src/`
2. **Build**: Run `npm run build` to compile
3. **Test**: Run `npm test` for basic testing
4. **Manual Testing**: Test with real SRT files
5. **Iterate**: Refine based on results
