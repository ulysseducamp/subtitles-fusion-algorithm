Let go!

23
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,000

[Claire] Raoul!

29
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,880
[Guédira] Lupin?

30
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,160
You're looking for a kid
dressed as Arsène Lupin?

31
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,560
[Claire] Yes! A little boy!

32
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,520
He's 14. He's our son.

33
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,120
He's got a top hat and… he has brown skin.

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,560
-Brown skin?
-[Claire] Yeah.

35
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,160
I saw a kid
fighting with a guy in the parking lot.

36
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,360
Wait for me!

37
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,280
Raoul!

38
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,360
Raoul!

39
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,479
They went that way.

40
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,600
In a gray BMW.

41
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,880
-Tell me what the guy looked like.
-Black. Beige coat.

42
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,480
Bad beard, thin.

43
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,880
Assane, Jesus!

44
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,080
This is your fault!

45
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,920
The guy from the train!
Who the fuck was that?

46
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,760
You lied to me!

47
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,520
Assane, no! What are you doing?

48
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,800
What are you doing?

49
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,400
Let go of that car!
Let go or I'll call the cops.

50
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,120
No. No police. All right?

51
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,200
Just calm down. I'll handle it. Okay?

52
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,720
-I swear I'm gonna do it.
-Claire, no police!

53
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,280
I'll get Raoul. Just trust me.

54
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,280
I am never trusting you again, Assane.

55
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,920
Claire, no police.

00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,680
Claire, your rehearsal go good?

69
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,080
What's wrong now? I can't walk with you?

70
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,240
What did I do?

71
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,680
What's going on?

72
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,960
Claire?

[Claire sighs]

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,040

[train brakes screeching]

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,240
I was only gone for a minute.
When I came back, it was like this.

79
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,160
And I bet nobody came forward.

80
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,000
[sighs] People will do anything.

81
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,080
Can you repair it?

82
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,280
No, no, no. Repairing it
would cost more than buying a new one.

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,840
Hang on.

84
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,720
[Claire]
How am I supposed to pass my audition?

85
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,040
[man] Hold on…

86
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,680
Voilà.

-[brief violin note]

88
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,320

[Claire plays emotional classical piece]

90
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,200
It sounds so incredible.

-[man chuckles]
-[Claire] How much is it?

92
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,600
-Three thousand francs.
-[Claire sighs]

93
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,720
I can't afford it.

94
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,840
Well, that's too bad.

95
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,200
Then let's rent it.

96
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
[Claire sighs]

97
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,440
And who's this?

98
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,840
Uh, Assane. He's a friend.

99
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,240
Your sign says it's 350 francs a day.

100
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,320
That's right. But not for you.

101
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,720
-Why not?
-Yeah, why not?

102
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,160
Because… you're in my shop.
It's my decision.

103
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,080
[Claire scoffs]

104
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,480
[man] Good luck with your audition.

105
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,640
Let's go, Assane.

106
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,520
We're leaving.

112
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,840
-Do you know the area?
-No.

113
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,360
Pull out your phone, see where we are.
Figure out where they could've gone.

114
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,640
[Guédira] Hang on.

115
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,360
Fuck, no reception!

116
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,000
Maybe they have a map in here.

117
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,160
They're passing through Bourneville.
No other road.

118
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,800
-How far?
-I'd say four, five kilometers maximum.

119
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,120
Maybe they stopped there
or someone saw them.

120
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,520
We have to stop there too.
I need to make a call.

121
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,040
Are you kidding me?

122
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,080
No. My wife's still in Étretat and there's
no reception. I need to let her know.

123
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,320
You know how wives are.

124
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,720
If I don't talk to her, she'll think
I'm the one who got kidnapped.

125
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,440
[engine revs]

126
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,560

Shit!

131
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,560
Stop looking at me.

132
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,680
Or I'll have to make you.

133
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,240
[engine stops]

134
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,919
Get out the car!

[Raoul groans]

136
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,360
Inside.

137
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,600
Get inside!

138
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,560
[Claire] So, what do we do?

139
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,920
We can take you to the station
to file a missing person report.

140
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,320
If we don't hear anything in 24 hours,
we send a general report to all services.

141
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,680
-That's it.
-A general report to all services?

142
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,280
You do realize
we're talking about a kidnapping, right?

143
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,320
Okay, you're a joke.

144
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,040
-Hey, where are you going?
-To find my son.

145
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,280
[church bell ringing]

146
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,560
If you make a sound, you're dead.

147
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,480
Good choice, kid.

148
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,560

You have a telephone?

155
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,480
I need some change.

156
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,040

00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,480
I'm in Bourneville, in Normandy.

161
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,840
What are you doing there?

162
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,960
I followed our client, like we planned.
But I wanted to tell you that…

163
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,800
there was a small setback.

164
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,640
-I'm here with his son now.
-With his son?

165
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,360
-That's right.
-It's not the son I want.

166
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,720
Clean up your mess, and do it properly!

167
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,640
Shit!

168
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,880

Sir?

179
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,920
Excuse me. Have you seen a gray car?

180
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,080
With a Black man driving, and a teenager?

181
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,160
Do you remember a gray car? Hey, sir!

182
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,480
Answer me, please.

183
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,960
Even "no" is a response.

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,440
-[Belkacem] <i>Are you still sick?</i>
-No, I'm in Normandy.

186
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,040
What the hell's in Normandy?
Get your ass back here. Shit's going down.

187
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,520
-What?
-[Belkacem] <i>We got the wrong Sernine.</i>

188
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,880
-Well, yeah, because he's here with me.
-What?

189
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,240
He's right in front of me.

190
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,760
-[Belkacem] <i>Sernine?</i>
-Yes, Sernine, yes, Sernine!

191
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,040
-I'm in Bourneville.
-Why the hell are you with him?

192
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,240
He's coming back.

193
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,600
[Belkacem]<i> Are you okay?</i>

194
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,480
<i>-You can't talk?</i>
-Yeah, that's right.

195
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,400
-Do you need backup?
-[Guédira]<i> Yep.</i>

196
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,520
We need to catch this guy.

197
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,280
Love you too.

198
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,800
Excuse me!

199
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,440
A man was here.
He's Black, he's driving a gray car.

200
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,200
With a 14-year-old boy
with brown skin and curly hair.

201
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,160
He's my son. He's been kidnapped.

202
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,040
So, if anyone knows anything,

203
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,760
speak up.

204
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,920
For customers.

205
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,360
-[man groans]
-I'm not playing.

206
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,520
[Guédira] That's him!

[tires screech]

208
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,120
-I'll take it from here. Thanks!
-I'm staying with you!

209
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,560
Trust me. I can help you get him.

210
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,040
Get in.

211
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,920
[tires screech]

212
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,960
Her exam is on Friday
in the 11th district.

213
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,000
-Why would someone break her violin?
-Because they were jealous. For real.

214
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,840
I heard her play. She's incredible.

215
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,320
So, if you find the violin,
you're her hero.

216
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,720
Yeah, well, at this point,
I'm more her problem than her hero.

217
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,960
The moron who runs the shop
won't rent her anything

218
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,800
because she's friends with a Black guy.

219
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,720
Seriously?

220
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,720
What would Lupin do in my place?

221
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,400
You'd know better than me.

222
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,120
I think
that he would go back to the store,

223
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,120
he'd steal a violin

224
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,440
and give it to Claire.

Right there!

231
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,040
I'M ON MY WAY!

232
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,720
-It's from my wife.
-All right.

[cell phone dings]

246

It's your son.

247
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,280
DAD, I TOOK THE GUY'S PHONE.

248
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,080
I GOT AWAY.

249
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,400

LET'S DO LIKE LUPIN DOES
WITH HIS DAUGHTER IN CAGLIOSTRO

254
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,840
Hang on.
It's not Lupin's daughter in <i>Cagliostro.</i>

255
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,920
-It's his son.
-Big fan of Lupin?

[chuckles softly] Yeah, I love it.

257
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,960
My son does too.

258
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,200
If he wrote this message,
he'll pick up on the error.

259
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,560
And if he doesn't…

260
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,560
It's a trap then.
