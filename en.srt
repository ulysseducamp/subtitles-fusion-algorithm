00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,498
Frank stole

1342
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,666
from my friends' moms.

1343
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,125
They know about it?

1344
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,377
I don't think so.

1345
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,922
Ah, you should pawn it, then.

1346
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,590
Gonna give it back.

1347
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,882
What, to Frank?

1348
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:54,927
To my friends.

1349
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,887
How are you even a Gallagher?

1350
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,513
Hey, uh, dinner's ready!

1351
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:00,223
[Debbie] Be there in a sec.

1352
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:01,600
Why, what are you doing?

1353
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,560
My boss said I pee too much.

1354
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,311
That's why I get paid

1355
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,311
less than the guys.

1356
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,355
So tomorrow, I'm not

1357
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,355
going to pee at all.

1358
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:09,608
Get paid less

1359
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:09,608
just for showing us that.

1360
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,401
Screw him.

1361
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,401
Like guys don't piss.

1362
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,695
It's total discrimination.

1363
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:15,572
Hey, I come bearing gifts.

1364
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,283
Oh, uh, Debs won't need any.

1365
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,785
What is that?

1366
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:22,245
It's best not to ask.

1367
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,289
So...

1368
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,958
I can get Ian's bail money.

1369
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:27,208
[Debbie] That's great.

1370
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,710
Yeah.

1371
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,378
You guys don't think he would

1372
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,422
skip out on me, do you?

1373
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,924
Is he taking his meds?

1374
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:35,508
Maybe not.

1375
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,761
Is he gonna be able

1376
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,761
to get his old EMT job back,

1377
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:39,846
or go back to being

1378
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:39,846
Gay Jesus?

1379
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:40,973
Beats me.

1380
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,682
Is he gonna pay back

1381
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,682
his bail?

1382
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:46,812
I don't know.

1383
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:46,812
Does any of that shit matter?

1384
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,397
How many times have we

1385
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,397
bailed out family before?

1386
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:52,150
Isn't that just the cost

1387
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:52,150
of being a Gallagher?

Have fun.

like rats?

1417
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,512
If you hadn't spread your legs

1418
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,512
for half these guys,

1419
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,181
- we wouldn't be here.

1420
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,181
- Don't blame this on me.

1421
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,183
You screwed just as many people

1422
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,183
as I did.

1423
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,101
[Sasha] I don't understand

1424
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,101
why we can't leave.

1425
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:10,228
It's not like we're gonna

1426
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:10,228
have sex

1427
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,688
and infect the rest

1428
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,688
of the world.

1429
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,314
[Darren] You're definitely

1430
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,314
not gonna have sex.

1431
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:16,317
I mean, you don't want to have

1432
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:16,317
sex more than quarterly.

1433
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,360
I have post-partum!

1434
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,404
For three years?

1435
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,239
Uh, in my experience,

1436
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,239
she's got

1437
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,657
quite an active libido,

1438
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,159
but hey, let's not fight.

1439
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:25,952
We gotta make the best

1440
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:25,952
of this situation.

1441
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:28,747
The best of this situation?

1442
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,540
You fucked all of our wives,

1443
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,540
Gallagher.

1444
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,834
Probably the reason

1445
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,834
for this whole damn thing.

1446
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:34,211
[Len] Yeah.

1447
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,795
Yeah, let's kill him.

1448
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,214
- [Wells] Yeah.

1449
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,214
- [Frank] Oh, will you--

1450
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,798
- Would you calm down?

1451
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,798
- Stop.

1452
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,966
Careful.

1453
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,966
Stop it.

1454
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,300
Look at the bright side!

1455
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,510
We're getting

1456
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,510
free medical care.

1457
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:43,469
Free medical care!

1458
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,263
You destroyed my marriage.

1459
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:47,891
I did you a favor!

1460
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:51,061
My penis might have actually

1461
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:51,061
helped you to heal.

1462
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:52,562
Did you ever think of that?

1463
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,397
[Wells] The hell

1464
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,397
are you talking about?

1465
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,191
Your bodies

1466
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,191
are developing immunity

1467
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:58,860
to a horrible disease

1468
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:58,860
thanks to me!

1469
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:00,528
Three horrible diseases.

1470
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,863
The fact that

1471
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,863
you're all cheating

1472
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:03,489
is a lot more serious

1473
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,200
than a couple of silly

1474
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:07,326
sexually transmitted diseases.

1475
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,745
I think you should use

1476
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,745
this time

1477
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,371
to reexamine

1478
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,371
your relationships.

1479
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,998
There's nothing wrong

1480
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,998
with our relationships.

1481
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,666
Is that what you think,

1482
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,666
Charlize?

1483
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,419
Because you told me

1484
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,419
you feel sexually invisible

1485
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:17,378
in front of Wells.

1486
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,838
What?

1487
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,838
That's bullshit.

1488
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,048
She said you don't find her

1489
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,048
attractive

1490
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,674
since she had your child.

1491
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,468
You saw the baby

1492
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,468
come out of that thing,

1493
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:25,137
and it grossed you out.

1494
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:26,638
You gotta get over it, man.

1495
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,639
Who the hell are you,

1496
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,307
to tell us what to do?

1497
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:32,310
I'm the guy who supplied

1498
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:32,310
your wives a service.

1499
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:33,812
That's who.

1500
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,940
You men have been

1501
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,940
neglecting them.

1502
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,483
Been off screwing other women

1503
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,110
because it's more exciting,

1504
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:41,527
but you have not put the time

1505
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,946
into your marriages,

1506
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:44,823
so I've had to do the work.

1507
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:47,533
Thank God I'm great at sex.

1508
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,995
It's probably 'cause

1509
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,995
I've had a lot of practice.

1510
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,246
A lotta practice.

1511
00:38:51,288 --> 00:38:53,539
Lotta, lotta, lotta practice.

1512
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,041
I'm gonna kill him.

1513
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:56,626
What is your problem, man?

1514
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,086
Will you--

1515
00:38:58,128 --> 00:39:00,505
[people shouting]

1516
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:03,175
[man] Come on,

1517
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:03,175
kill the bastard!

1518
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:04,717

Look, Frank might have a point.

1522
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,561
- He does?

1523
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,561
- Yeah!

1524
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,106
Listen to Darren.

1525
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:20,358
The truth is,

1526
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,485
Sasha,

1527
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:25,030
I've been working too much,

1528

00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,637
Did you talk to my mother?

1905
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:16,054
Nope, never rang.

1906
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,890
I did drop it

1907
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,890
in the toilet, though.

1914
00:50:31,863 --> 00:50:34,198
Just wanted to prove

Don't worry, sir.

1920
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:40,204
Nobody will ever
