# Smart Subtitles - Master Document

## 1. Project Overview

### Core Concept and Vision
Smart Subtitles is an adaptive bilingual subtitle system that creates personalized learning experiences by intelligently switching between target language (language being learned) and native language subtitles based on the user's vocabulary knowledge. The system uses frequency lists to determine which words the user "knows" and makes real-time decisions about subtitle language selection.

### Target Users and Use Cases
- **Language learners** at intermediate to advanced levels
- **Self-directed learners** who want personalized content
- **Educators** creating adaptive learning materials
- **Content creators** producing bilingual educational content

### Key Value Proposition
- **Adaptive Learning**: Automatically adjusts difficulty based on vocabulary knowledge
- **Seamless Experience**: No manual switching between subtitle languages
- **Vocabulary Building**: Inline translation for single unknown words
- **Time Synchronization**: Advanced algorithm for perfect subtitle timing alignment
- **Multi-language Support**: Works with English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, German, and Italian

## 2. Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **TypeScript**: Core application logic and type safety
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for CLI application
- **Python 3**: Lemmatization using `simplemma` library
- **DeepL API**: High-quality translation service for inline translations
- **SRT Format**: Standard subtitle format for input/output

### Data Flow and Processing Pipeline

                Text)        subtitles)      matching)
```

### Key Algorithms

#### Bidirectional Time Synchronization
The system implements a sophisticated algorithm for aligning subtitles between different language versions:

1. **Temporal Intersection Detection**: Uses `hasIntersection()` function to find overlapping subtitle segments
2. **Overlapping Subtitle Merging**: Combines multiple overlapping subtitles into single segments
3. **Time Range Mapping**: Maps subtitle timing between target and native language versions
4. **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation when perfect alignment isn't possible

#### Vocabulary Analysis Engine
- **Lemmatization**: Uses Python `simplemma` for accurate word stemming
- **Proper Noun Detection**: Intelligent identification of names, places, brands
- **Contraction Handling**: Special processing for English contractions (e.g., "don't" ‚Üí "do", "not")
- **Frequency-based Knowledge**: Assumes user knows top N most frequent words

#### Decision Engine Logic
```
For each target subtitle:
1. Extract and lemmatize words
2. Check against known vocabulary set
3. If all words known ‚Üí Show target language
4. If multiple unknown words ‚Üí Show native language
5. If single unknown word ‚Üí Apply inline translation (if enabled)
6. Fallback to native language if translation fails
```

- **Maintainability**: Each language handles what it does best

#### CLI-First Design
- **Simplicity**: Easy to integrate with existing workflows
- **Automation**: Can be scripted and automated
- **Foundation**: Provides solid base for future web/extension development

#### Caching Strategy
- **Translation Caching**: 24-hour cache for DeepL translations
- **Memory Efficiency**: Prevents redundant API calls
- **Cost Optimization**: Reduces API usage costs

### Trade-offs Considered

#### Performance vs. Accuracy
- **Lemmatization**: Chose accuracy (Python) over performance (pure JavaScript)
- **Translation**: Caching balances cost vs. real-time translation needs
- **Processing**: Batch processing vs. real-time streaming

#### Complexity vs. Functionality
- **Proper Noun Detection**: Complex logic for better accuracy
- **Contraction Handling**: Extensive mapping for English contractions
- **Time Synchronization**: Sophisticated algorithm for perfect alignment

### Performance Considerations

#### Memory Usage
- **Frequency Lists**: Loaded once and kept in memory for fast access
- **Translation Cache**: Limited size with timestamp-based expiration
- **Subtitle Objects**: Efficient data structures for large subtitle files

#### Processing Speed
- **Batch Lemmatization**: Processes multiple lines at once
- **Parallel Processing**: Potential for future optimization
- **Early Exit**: Stops processing when decision is made

## 5. Key Challenges & Solutions

### Subtitle Synchronization Problems

#### Challenge: Temporal Misalignment
**Problem**: Different language subtitle files often have different timing and segmentation.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented `mergeOverlappingSubtitles()` function
- Created `hasIntersection()` for temporal overlap detection
- Added fallback mechanisms for imperfect alignment

#### Challenge: Subtitle Segmentation Differences
**Problem**: Target and native language subtitles may split content differently.

**Solution**:
- Combines multiple overlapping native subtitles
- Maintains chronological order in merged content
- Preserves original timing boundaries

### Technical Hurdles Encountered

#### Challenge: Proper Noun Detection
**Problem**: Distinguishing between proper nouns and regular capitalized words.

**Solution**:
- Implemented context-aware proper noun detection
- Uses frequency list to determine if capitalized word is common
- Handles sentence-initial capitalization correctly

#### Challenge: English Contraction Processing
**Problem**: Contractions like "don't" need special handling for vocabulary analysis.

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive `ENGLISH_CONTRACTIONS` mapping
- Expands contractions before vocabulary checking
- Maintains original text for display purposes

#### Challenge: API Rate Limiting
**Problem**: DeepL API has rate limits that could cause failures.

**Solution**:
- Implemented configurable rate limiting delays
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff
- Created efficient caching to minimize API calls

### Solutions Implemented or Attempted

#### Successful Solutions
- **Bidirectional Synchronization**: Advanced algorithm for perfect timing alignment
- **Inline Translation**: Seamless single-word translation integration
- **Caching System**: Efficient translation caching with expiration
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful fallback when translations fail

#### Attempted Solutions
- **Pure JavaScript Lemmatization**: Rejected due to inferior accuracy
- **Simple Time Matching**: Replaced with sophisticated overlap detection
- **Basic Vocabulary Checking**: Enhanced with proper noun detection

### Known Limitations

#### Current Limitations
- **Language Support**: Limited to languages supported by simplemma and DeepL
- **Subtitle Format**: Only supports SRT format (could extend to others)
- **Vocabulary Model**: Assumes frequency-based knowledge (could be personalized)
- **Real-time Processing**: CLI-based, not real-time streaming

#### Technical Constraints
- **API Dependencies**: Requires DeepL API key for inline translation
- **Python Dependency**: Requires Python 3 and simplemma for lemmatization
- **Memory Usage**: Frequency lists loaded entirely into memory
- **Processing Speed**: Sequential processing (could be parallelized)
